public class HeapSort {
	//meant for sorting tree, but also works with array
	//a tree will be lopsided it it starts with a 1 (hence, Btrees)
	
	//Rule 1.	parent needs to be greater than children
	//Rule 2.	fill one level before starting the next level
	
	//every child has 2 parents
	
	//if you try adding a number to a tree that is greater than the parent,
	//switch the numbers in the tree
	//and the location in the array
	
	//find out who a number's parent is by dividing it by:
	//(currentIndex-1)/2
	//if it's bigger, swap. then compare again
	
	//top will always be biggest
	
	//find children:
	//(index*2), (index*2 +1)	?fis this true?
